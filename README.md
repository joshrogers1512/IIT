### Steven Jones		-	Full Stack Developer

Full stack developer sits a little below average shown in figure 1. 

Required Skills;
- Programming Skills
- JavaScript
- SQL
- PHP
- HTML, CSS
- Collaboration
- GIT

Team Work

Javascript and SQL are very highly demanded skills sets and detailed in Figure 2.  A full stack developer needs a broad range of skills but it was interesting to see PHP, HTML and CSS was not included in Figure 2 and GIT was relatively low for what I would have perceived.

Figure 2 is also supported by the below link to an interesting Hay’s article;

https://www.hays.com.au/report/information-technology-16659

Personally, my ideal job has not changed after the above insite.  I see that demand and pay is not the highest for this discipline but I already understand the rewards and thoroughly enjoy it.



### Ryan Mansbridge	-  Graphic designer

The required skills are:
- IT skills 
- Graphic design

Generic skills
- Creativity 
- Team work
- Presentation skills

The required skills for my ideal job are pretty basic, graphic design skills are just above average when it comes to the demand in that skill as seen in figure 2. When it comes to the demand for generic skills , they all sit just above the halfway mark.

My ideal job as a  graphic designer hasn’t changed even though the demand for the job is the second highest on the graph seen in figure 1. The skills that are needed for the job are very easy to learn and I think the end result of becoming a full time graphic designer would be extremely rewarding.  

### Joshua Rogers  -	Full Stack Developer

Required Skills;

- Programming Skills
- JavaScript
- SQL
- PHP
- HTML, CSS
- Collaboration
- GIT
- Team Work


The required skills for my ideal job you will find are required for the majority of IT jobs, although you generally will not need the whole suite of skills required like you are as a full stack developer. If you are going to be a more specific FE or BE developer then you will only need around 40% - 60% of the skills needed.

Demand for a full stack developer is not that high, most companies are tending to leaning towards having developers who suit a specific field rather than having the capability to attend to all facets of development.

My current programming skills are very limited, and I have a lot of work, study & time required to be committed before I will even be able to consider my ideal job.

# IT Technologies 

## Machine Learning

### What does it do?

Machine learning is a subgroup or application of artificial intelligence.  From a high level view it is complex algorithms have the ability to learn and improve independently, without being explicitly programmed.

Some good examples of day to day applications that make use of machine learning are;

Virtual Personal Assistants Siri, Alexa, Google are becoming very popular as in home hubs as virtual personal
assistants. These assistants make use of machine learning by analysing the information and queries given by the users and using them to predict future enquiries and tailored preferences to your profile.

Social Media Services
We should all be familiar with the numerous social media applications available but may not be so versed in the background machine learnings.  Most social media use machine learning to personalise news feed,  ads targeting or even making suggestions on friends and clubs that you may have been evaluated to be interested in.

In the coming years we would expect to see the advent of driverless vehicles on the road.  These are already in development and pose a revolution in the transport industry.  The technology that is enabling this is computer vision.  Computer vision is a field of machine learning that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.  They can use images from cameras and videos and deep learning models.  In some industries computer vision has improved so much that it has exceeded the ability of humans.  Computer vision is accelerating fast using machine learning techniques.


### What is the likely impact? 

In the advent of driverless vehicles a new era in human life shall unfold.  There are both benefits and disadvantage some of which are discussed below;

Reduction in traffic accidents and death - Motor accidents shall be greatly reduced by the introduction of driverless vehicles.  Machines shall not fatigue and tire, lose concentration and shall in time exceed human ability to detect hazards and potential accidents.  This is an enormous benefit to society.
Reduction in property damage - Flow on effects from the reduction in traffic accidents will be the reductions in property damage, personal vehicles and other damage caused by the vehicle.  This also will benefit society in terms of individual capital.
Reduction in energy costs - From the reduction in the total number of vehicles required, reduction in congestion and the learning ability of the vehicles to drive as efficiently as possible overall energy costs will be reduced.
Reduction in traffic congestion - Driverless vehicles shall have less need for traffic regulating devices such as traffic lights and ramps etc. as they shall easily be able to merge and avoid other traffic through networking abilities and as such shall reduce congestion.
Reduction in pollution - Less traffic, less congestion and efficient driving will result in less pollution to the environment.
Unemployment - A disadvantage of driverless vehicles is that they shall make transporters of good and taxiing services redundant.
Vulnerability to hackers - Vehicles being subject to attacks is a great concern with driverless vehicles and strict measures must be taken prior to launch to avoid this potential threat.
Privacy issues - Privacy is a concern, customers will not want their travels recorded and potentially used and careful privacy policies will need to be created to avoid potential ethical dilemmas.
Collapse of some auto industries and insurance industries
The reduction in the number owned vehicles will have a massive effect on the automotive industry.  This would cascade through their entire supply chain again contributing to unemployment.


### How does it affect you?

For students ………...I do not see  that this would affect our daily routines a great deal  


# Cloud, Cloud Services & Servers

### What does it do?

The Cloud in simple terms is the delivery of computing services - including servers, storage, software, databases and analytics - over the Internet offering faster innovation, resource & economies of scale. Majority of the time, you only pay for the cloud services you use, helping you lower your costs, run your infrastructure and more efficiently scale your business needs.

Cloud Computing can be broken into three main types

- Public Cloud - Public clouds are managed & operated by third-party cloud service providers. They deliver computing resources such as storage and servers via the Internet. All the hardware, software and other supporting frameworks are owned and run by the provider. 


- Private Cloud - Private cloud is cloud computing assets used completely by a single business. Private clouds can be physically on a company's data centre. Companies can also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.

- Hybrid Cloud - Hybrid clouds merge both private and public clouds. Combining them by technology that allows data & applications to move between both types of clouds (Public & Private). This gives business greater flexibility and more deployments options. 


Cloud Computing can also be broken down into three services as well: 

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) - Software as a service is the method of delivering software via the Internet. They are typically delivered on a subscription basis, and in a way that any maintenance can be handled by patches & software updates. Users can access these applications generally over the Internet via web browser, phone or tablet.  

- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) - Iaas is the most straightforward category of cloud computing services. With Infrastructure as a service, you are renting the Infrastructure, servers, Virtual machines & operating systems. IaaS is generally working on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) - PaaS refers to Cloud computing services that provide environments to building & developing software. With the goal in mind of aiming to make it easier for developers to create websites or mobile applications without needing to worry about managing the infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.



### What is the likely impact? 

Cloud services have had a significant impact on the business of all sizes. As it has continued to grow, it has helped business’ & individuals with the following: 

Cost Savings - The cloud has allowed companies to save on costs due to
Reduction in Hardware cost. Instead of purchasing in-house equipment, hardware needs are managed by the vendor.
Labour & Maintenance - As a result of the hardware being owned by vendors and stored in off-site locations, there is less demand for in-house IT staff. If servers or other hardware need repairs or upgrades, it is the responsibility of the vendor and doesn’t cost your company any time or money.
Productivity - In addition to the outright labour savings, cloud computing can be extremely cost-effective for enterprises because of the increase in workforce productivity. The deployment of cloud software is notably faster than a standard installation. Instead of the weeks or months that a standard company-wide installation may take, cloud software deployment can happen in a matter of hours.

Efficiency - Cloud computing allows a business to communicate easier beyond the older, more traditional methods. The key benefit, enabling team members to work & collaborate data on the same document at the same time 

Agility - Cloud computing is giving users access to a broader range of technologies and allowing people to have the ability to obtain better resources needed to build almost anything. 


### How does it affect you?

Cloud Computing has got to the stage where it profoundly affects almost all humans on a daily perspective. Whether that's a uni student using google documents to collaborate on a group project, to primary school students & teachers using virtual desktop programs due to our current landscape, and even your Grandma who is using Facebook.


# Natural Language processing and chatterbots

### What does it do? 

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is software that can turn unstructured data such a large volume of text into usable structured data using algorithms & patterning. The principal objective of this technology is to assist & decipher human language into more valuable data sets. 

This technology has been around since the mid-’90s, although like almost all tech, it continues to evolve like practically all tech. We have seen in the past couple of years Natural Language Processing using both Speech to text & Deep learning in such devices as Google Alexa. Transitioning NLP from a tool that is used to crunch large volumes of unstructured data for business’ to a tool that is now used in households. 

The biggest hurdle that NLP currently faces is a shortage of training data because NLP is a diversified field with many different tasks, most of these tasks contain specific datasets in which only a few thousand have human-labelled training examples.

However, the implementation of deep learning-based NLP training models is assisting in closing the gap in this data. Researchers are developing a wide span variety of techniques for training language representation models. They are doing this by using a tremendous amount of unannotated text on the web; this is known as pre-training. 

With the use of these new NLP training processes,there has been a significant increase in benchmark testing for evaluating NLP systems at a range of tasks spanning logic & common sense understanding. These significant increases in NLP learning in combination with advances in Machine learning are seeing massive progress in the capabilities of devices such as google Alexa & in-built iOS functionality Siri.


Although we see significant advances in capability for above mentioned Google Alexa & Siri, NLP is also being used for software such as; 

- Grammar & Spelling checks (Grammarly)
- Machine Translation (Google Translate)
- Message & Chat Bots
- Customer Service Automation


As technology progresses, NLP will continue to advance in combination with machine learning & other technology. We are already seeing smarter chatbots that are using both Deep learning & NLP to analyse human response better & respond accordingly, and this will only get better and better. A great example of this is Spotify’s “Release Radar” playlists for users. 


### What is the likely impact? 

Natural Language Processing is an amazing tool that has the ability to impact a wide demographic of people in a very positive way, from assisting travellers in foreign countries using applications that scan foreign language and instantly translate to your own, to now being able to read sign language and with the assistance of NGL communicate to people who do not know a single sign language signal.

NLP has the ability to affect everybody in some way, although the industries & fields that will be most affected by the continual progression of NLP at this stage seem to be the Financial, Legal & Healthcare systems.

All of these fields deal with a large volume of text that they need to manually read and translate into usable and non-usable data. Whether its extracting meaning from content, data and document collections, all at breakneck speed or analysing reams of medical records and identifying hidden correlations between symptoms, diagnoses, medications and treatments. These are all tasks that NLP can now assist in saving hours of manpower, time and even sometimes costs on. 

NLP will not put jobs in these fields at risk, although it will drastically transform some of the training & skills required to perform. NLP will also have a similar impact on the rest of the job market; It shouldn’t cause a bulk loss of jobs although it will certainly change the required training and skill set of many, only really having a potentially negative effect on the lower tier customer service jobs that now require minimal training. These are using NLP can now be managed by chatbots more & more.



### How will this affect you?

Currently, NLP has a significant effect on most people's daily lives in which most people would not even realise. From your emails filtering what is spam and what isn't, to predictive text on your mobile device that allows you to type at a fast pace and not have to worry about small spelling & grammar errors. 

The impact that NLP has on people's daily lives will only continue to grow for the majority of the population as we make advances in NLP, NLG & Machine learning. 


# Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices

### What does it do? 

Raspberry Pi is the name of a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a UK charity that aims to educate people in computing and create more convenient access to computing education. The Raspberry Pi launched in 2012, and there have been several iterations and variations released since then. 

The tiny single-board computer is designed to help people learn to program. Despite its small size and simple design, it can be used for a range of tasks as diverse as emulating classic computer games or acting as a Bluetooth receiver for you old speakers. There is such a wide range of projects people can create with the Raspberry Pi. Linux is the operating system that runs on Raspberry Pis, 

The latest Raspberry Pi 4 has a quad-core 1.5GHz 64-bit ARM power plant. The entry-level model contains 1GB of RAM, with the ability to spend more and get 2GB or 4GB.

Other changes for the latest model include stepping up to HDMI 2.0 with HDR, USB 3.0, Bluetooth 5.0 and USB-C power. Apart from the extra power, one of the most significant changes in the switch to twin 4K micro-HDMI video ports. The ability to connect two screens at once is convenient for programmers who want to edit code on one screen while seeing the results on another.

Due to the nature of what the Raspberry Pi tech is, there is no direct trajectory that we expect this hardware to get to within the future. Although what we do know is that it will continually progress and update its hardware as time goes on just like it has from the early Raspberry Pi models in 2012 to the current model now. 


### What is the likely impact? 

The Raspberry Pi has been hugely impactful on people of all ages worldwide, selling over 10 million units. The Raspberry Pi has given people the opportunity to learn coding for an affordable price, from classrooms, libraries, research laboratories, peoples studies and the Industrial environment. 

The most significant impact the Raspberry Pi has had on people is it has encouraged them to experiment with computers and allow them to know that you don't have to have years & years of programming experience to try your hand at it and achieve something great.

The Raspberry Pi has had no adverse effect on the job market if anything it has assisted with upskilling junior IT employees as they look to learn & transition further into their IT careers.


### How will this affect you?

The Raspberry Pi will not affect the majority of the population's daily life. For some, the Raspberry Pi will not be part of their entire life, although for an Individual who works/studies IT they are almost guaranteed that they will cross paths with it at some stage. For those who interact with a Raspberry Pi during their daily life, it will most likely be built/coded by them in a way that can assist making a part of their everyday life more efficient, like syncing your house's lighting system with your google Alexa, so it's voice-controlled.


# Project Ideas

## Summary

Note: that this is a continuation from an idea Steve Jones concepted in his ethics module that we thought was good to look at.

Driverless Motorcycle (DM) will offer residents of Melbourne and surrounding areas a commuting/taxiing/luxury service via an autonomous self driving motorcycle. Our Motorcycle’s shal be electric powered with a range before recharge of 160 Km. Customers shall be able to book via and a web page or application whereby they can see the estimated pickup time trip duration prior to paying through the online portal. Customers shall also be able to order their required helmet size. 

The service shall not require passengers to have a current motorcycle license as our
motorcycles shal be self balancing and self driving so no decision making is required by our
Passengers.

DM’s services has an enormous potential and its success will be attributed to the
Following;

DM’s offer budget rates when compared to other public transports rates such as taxis and Uber as we have the benefit of no driver expenses. We also minimise cost by taking advantage of electric power which is a fraction of the cost of combustible Fuels.
DM’s offer quicker transit times as our motorcycles shall take advantage of motorcycle lanes.
DM’s electric bikes also compliment environmental requirements by minimizing the pollution seen with conventional transports.

DM’s short term goal is to initially launch in Melbourne and surrounding areas. This
non-nationwide rollout will minimise initial investment until a measure of success and use of
our services can be fully appreciated. In Melbourne we are anticipating 2630171 trips per
week with an expected 8.9Km average distance travelled.

Pending the success of this Melbourne launch DM’s future plans would be to then
consider a nationwide roll out.

# Group Reflection

## Josh 

### What could be improved
The critical thing we could have improved on was after joining the group kicking off a group discussion earlier and setting up a plan. In the end, this had no adverse effect on the group's productivity & cohesion, although it would have given us a little more breathing room.

### At least one surprising thing
I think how easy our group was able to make decisions and delegate tasks. There was zero conflict or issues when planning or completing the work; it was surprising compared to previous experiences.

### At least one thing that you have learned about groups
Not all group projects are hard and require a strong leader to guide the project. We were able to achieve what we wanted with civil group conversations & decisions. 

## Ryan

### What went well:
I Think the whole project went really well and and all of us worked good with each other there was no conflict between us which made it easier for us to get project done 

### What could be improved:
The main thing I think we could have improved was maybe start things off a bit earlier. It took us a while to finally get into a group meeting where we could all discuss what we had to do and plan the whole project. 

### At least one surprising thing:
The main thing that surprised me was the fact that we all came up with a decision really quickly with no conflict at all ,we all worked really well with each other.

### One thing i have learnt about groups:
The main thing I learnt about groups from this project was that if everyone is on the same page and there is no conflict, group projects can run extremely smoothly and another thing i learnt was that not you don't need to have a leader all the time, you should be able to make a group decision.  


## Steve

### What went well:
The use of the online coloberate software was great.  Google Docs, Hangouts, Slack and Discord.  The team members have also been both resourceful and supportive.

### What could be improved:
I found the allocation to groups was not well described, we lost a lot of time and my time outside of the group just trying to figure out how to get in a group.

### At least one surprising thing:
Although we did not have the full amount of time due to point two I was surprised at how quickly the document came together.

### One thing i have learnt about groups:
If team members have and understand a common goal then work will come together easily and in good quality.  I have seen in other groups I have been in, this was not shared between the members, in one instance this resulted in a very poor Java program.  Working in this team was refreshing and efficient.
