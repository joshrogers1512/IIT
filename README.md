### Introduction

**Name:** Joshua Rogers

**Student Number:** s3540958

**Email Address:** s3540958@student.rmit.edu.au

I was born in Australia, and come from two parents Australian born parents, although while growing up I had the privilege to be spend time in both the United States & New Zealand during both my primary & senior school education periods. Although spending time in both those countries growing up, I came back to Melbourne to complete years 10-12 of my High School educations, and my VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education). 

After completing High School, I took some time off to travel around both the United States & Europe. After this I have had two seperate attempts at completing a bachelors degree in which both I have withdrawn about 50-75% way through after finding I did not have the passion or drive for these fields.

Since my last attempt at Uni, I have since landed myself a job working in sports tech for the past 4 years, falling completely in love with it. Now spending majority of my time behind a screen these days, I'm lucky enough to have the ultimate release by being able to escape to a farm in South East Gippsland run by my parents. Getting down there to assist with all animal & regular farm related tasks is something that I truely love and provides me the perfect balance.

### Interest in IT

You should answer the questions below as best you can. Each answer should be one paragraph in length.

**What is my interest in IT? When did my interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?**

As I briefly touched on above, about 4 years ago I moved into a IT/tech industry when taking on a role at company FanHub Media. Starting as a customer support staff member, I have made my way up to a Product Manager, with experience managing app & website builds that have reached a user databases of over 300,000. 

Intially working at FanHub Media was easy due to my strong interest in sports, although as my time at the company has progressed I have found myself more & more intrigued in the technical side of project builds. Watching & managing our Frontend, Backend & App developer teams build such amazing products from the ground up is what has fueled by desire and interest in IT. 

**Why did I choose to come to RMIT?**

The key reason why I chose Bachelor or IT at RMIT was that I am able to complete this study 100% online. Allowing me to squeeze it in around my busy work schedule, while also giving me the flexibility to complete a move to my companys London office later in the year.

**What do I expect to learn during your studies?**

I'm going into my studies with 2 key goals; 

1. Increase Technical Knowledge to assist with Product Management role at work. 

2. Equip myself with the skills to have the capabilty to create & build web projects myself, I want to come out of this with a dynamic set of developer skills.
