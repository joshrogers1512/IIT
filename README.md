### Introduction

**Name:** Joshua Rogers

**Student Number:** s3540958

**Email Address:** s3540958@student.rmit.edu.au

I was born in Australia, and come from two parents Australian born parents, although while growing up I had the privilege to be spend time in both the United States & New Zealand during both my primary & senior school education periods. Although spending time in both those countries growing up, I came back to Melbourne to complete years 10-12 of my High School educations, and my VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education). 

After completing High School, I took some time off to travel around both the United States & Europe. After this I have had two seperate attempts at completing a bachelors degree in which both I have withdrawn about 50-75% way through after finding I did not have the passion or drive for these fields.

Since my last attempt at Uni, I have since landed myself a job working in sports tech for the past 4 years, falling completely in love with it. Now spending majority of my time behind a screen these days, I'm lucky enough to have the ultimate release by being able to escape to a farm in South East Gippsland run by my parents. Getting down there to assist with all animal & regular farm related tasks is something that I truely love and provides me the perfect balance.




### Interest in IT

You should answer the questions below as best you can. Each answer should be one paragraph in length.

**What is my interest in IT? When did my interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?**

As I briefly touched on above, about 4 years ago I moved into a IT/tech industry when taking on a role at company FanHub Media. Starting as a customer support staff member, I have made my way up to a Product Manager, with experience managing app & website builds that have reached a user databases of over 300,000. 

Intially working at FanHub Media was easy due to my strong interest in sports, although as my time at the company has progressed I have found myself more & more intrigued in the technical side of project builds. Watching & managing our Frontend, Backend & App developer teams build such amazing products from the ground up is what has fueled by desire and interest in IT. 

**Why did I choose to come to RMIT?**

The key reason why I chose Bachelor or IT at RMIT was that I am able to complete this study 100% online. Allowing me to squeeze it in around my busy work schedule, while also giving me the flexibility to complete a move to my companys London office later in the year.

**What do I expect to learn during your studies?**

I'm going into my studies with 2 key goals; 

1. Increase Technical Knowledge to assist with Product Management role at work. 

2. Equip myself with the skills to have the capabilty to create & build web projects myself, I want to come out of this with a dynamic set of developer skills.

### Project Idea

**Overview**

The product that I would bring to life would be a Customisable Statistics Website. Allowing clients to swiftly bring to life a customisable branded website that can display a variety of statistics, profiles and historical data. 

Clients would gain access a Backend CMS in which they can input data both manually or ingest via a CSV document, via this CMS they will also be able to upload the sites branding including primary, secondary & third colours that will help style the website. They will also have the ability to add their own headers, footers and MREC ads to really make every site feel like their own custom built website.

This product will help grass roots sporting leagues, by allowing them promote both their league and the players within the league by sharing player, game & season statistics via this customisable branded website.

This will allow grass roots leagues to share valuable statistics and data with not only fans of their leagues, but also other interested teams from higher level sporting leagues. Giving players from hard to access leagues a better chance of getting recruited & researched by professional sporting leagues. 

Although this product will benefit grass roots sporting leagues, there’s nothing to say that your local bowling club, or your group of mates Fantasy Football league can’t create their own completely custom site with all of their leagues historical data & statistics.

**Description of Site Logic**

Backend CMS

The backend CMS will be the main crux of the product. Each client will be given access to their own Backend CMS, the ability to have over 10 user logins. 

Here they will be add the following details; 

Style Guide & Branding 
-	Here the client will be able to select Primary, Secondary & Third (Optional) colours hex codes that will style majority of the website. 
-	Section to upload site headers, footers & MREC ads. These must fit specific specification requirements

Statistic Tables & Sections
-	Client can add as many different Statistic tables via both manual adding statistics, or ingesting via CSV format. 
-	On this table client can add filters &  links on specific table options to other pages on the site.

Static Content
-	Here the client will be able to customise the site landing page
-	They will also be able to add as many static content/notice board pages to the site. This is a great way to add pages with a lot of text like league fixtures. 


Release Newest Changes to Production 
-	This will simply be a page in which will allow the client to push all new changes on UAT to production after they have tested them. 


_Each section will have a Publish Changes button that will push any changes they have made straight to their UAT environment for testing._


Frontend Skeleton Template – React 

- The frontend will be built on react framework. It will be built in a template style, that will allow clients to style it perfectly via making changes on the BE CMS.



Domain/Subdomain

- Each client that comes aboard will have the option to build their site on a stand alone domain if they have the money to purchase, although if they don’t they won’t need to worry about purchasing their own domain for the site to live on. 

- Each site URL will be a subdomain of the master site. Example, if grass roots league called Chester Football League came aboard as a client and didn’t want to purchase their own domain they would be given a subdomain like the following – www.masterstats/chesterfootballelague. 




**Skills Required**

_Team Required_

Account Manager/s: Key role will be to help sell the product to grass root sporting leagues.  

Product Manager/s: Key role will be first manage the initial project build, and second to maintain product updates, as well as assist with bugfixing raised by clients. 

Frontend Developer/s: Must have great react knowledge, and will be vital in building the initial framework & templated FE.

Backend Developer/s: Key role will be setting up & building the BE CMS.

Designer/s: Will be required initially while planning out how the sites are to work from a UI & UX perspective.



**Outcome**

If the project is to be successful it will help grass root sporting leagues engage in deeper way than they ever have with their fans, allowing them to keep up to date on more than just weekly scores when they can’t get to games. 

There is no real future progression or evolution for this product as its really quite simple. If things were to go really well, I would look at integrating the BE CMS with native apps as the next possible step.
