### Steven Jones		-	Full Stack Developer

Full stack developer sits a little below average shown in figure 1. 

Required Skills;
- Programming Skills
- JavaScript
- SQL
- PHP
- HTML, CSS
- Collaboration
- GIT

Team Work

Javascript and SQL are very highly demanded skills sets and detailed in Figure 2.  A full stack developer needs a broad range of skills but it was interesting to see PHP, HTML and CSS was not included in Figure 2 and GIT was relatively low for what I would have perceived.

Figure 2 is also supported by the below link to an interesting Hay’s article;

Personally, my ideal job has not changed after the above insite.  I see that demand and pay is not the highest for this discipline but I already understand the rewards and thoroughly enjoy it.



### Ryan Mansbridge	-  Graphic designer

The required skills are:
- IT skills 
- Graphic design

Generic skills
- Creativity 
- Team work
- Presentation skills

The required skills for my ideal job are pretty basic, graphic design skills are just above average when it comes to the demand in that skill as seen in figure 2. When it comes to the demand for generic skills , they all sit just above the halfway mark.

My ideal job as a  graphic designer hasn’t changed even though the demand for the job is the second highest on the graph seen in figure 1. The skills that are needed for the job are very easy to learn and I think the end result of becoming a full time graphic designer would be extremely rewarding.

The required skills for my ideal job you will find are required for the majority of IT jobs, although you generally will not need the whole suite of skills required like you are as a full stack developer. If you are going to be a more specific FE or BE developer then you will only need around 40% - 60% of the skills needed.

Demand for a full stack developer is not that high, most companies are tending to leaning towards having developers who suit a specific field rather than having the capability to attend to all facets of development.

My current programming skills are very limited, and I have a lot of work, study & time required to be committed before I will even be able to consider my ideal job.
